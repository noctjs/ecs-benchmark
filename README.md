The best result for each benchmark is marked in bold text. Note that run to run variance for these benchmarks is typically 1-4%. Any benchmarks within a few percent of each other should be considered “effectively equal”. The above benchmarks are run on node v17.8.0.

## Benchmarks

### Packed Iteration (5 queries)

This benchmark is designed to test the core overheads involved in component iteration when multiple queries are run.

- **Dataset:** 1,000 entities, each with `(A, B, C, D, E)` components.
- **Test:**
  - Iterate through all entities with `A` and double its value.
  - Iterate through all entities with `B` and double its value.
  - Iterate through all entities with `C` and double its value.
  - Iterate through all entities with `D` and double its value.
  - Iterate through all entities with `E` and double its value.

### Simple Iteration

This benchmark is designed to test how efficiently the ECS can run multiple independent systems.

- **Dataset:**
  - 1,000 entities with `(A, B)` components
  - 1,000 entities with `(A, B, C)` components
  - 1,000 entities with `(A, B, C, D)` components
  - 1,000 entities with `(A, B, C, E)` components
- **Test:** Three systems accessing the following components, where each system swaps the values stored in each component:
  - `(A, B)`
  - `(C, D)`
  - `(C, E)`

### Fragmented Iteration

This benchmark is designed to test how the ECS handles iteration through a fragmented dataset.

- **Dataset:** 26 component types (`A` through `Z`), each with 100 entities plus a `Data` component.
- **Test:**
  - Iterate through all entities with a `Data` component and double its value.
  - Iterate through all entities with a `Z` component and double its value.

### Entity Cycle

This benchmark is designed to test the base cost of constructing and destroying entities into the ECS.

- **Dataset:** 1,000 entities with a single `A` component.
- **Test:** Iterate through all entities, and create 1 entity with a `B` component. Then iterate through all entities with a `B` component and destroy them.

### Add / Remove

This benchmark is designed to test how quickly the ECS can add and then remove a component from an existing entity.

- **Dataset:** 1,000 entities with a single `A` component.
- **Test:** Iterate through all entities, adding a `B` component. Then iterate through all entities again, removing their `B` component.
